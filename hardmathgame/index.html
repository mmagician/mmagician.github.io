Story When I was a teenager, I remember our math teacher would show us a game at the end of the class if we had extra time. He would project a series of slides onto a screen. On each slide, there were four squares, each with an integer on it. The goal of the game was coming up with a sequence of operations (only addition and multiplication were allowed) that would use all the four numbers and arrive at 24."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://HungryCatsStudio.github.io/hardmathgame/"><meta property="article:section" content><meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-08-11T19:14:50+02:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2021-08-11T19:14:50+02:00"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Hard Math Game"><meta name=twitter:description content="Hard Math Game Download from Google Play Store

He would project a series of slides onto a screen. On each slide, there were four squares, each with an integer on it. The goal of the game was coming up with a sequence of operations (only addition and multiplication were allowed) that would use all the four numbers and arrive at 24.</p><p>This was sometime around 2008-10. Fast forward a few years - I learned to code and was especially familiar with Java, since that&rsquo;s what they taught us at uni. I always remembered that game from high school (maybe &lsquo;coz I was usually top of the class?). Towards the end of 2016 I started writing a mobile version of the game, which would become Hard Math Game - I never remembered the name of the original, and I kinda liked this <strong>creative</strong> name. This was a part-time effort, a side project, and so took me a while to get things released.</p><p>Finally, after quitting a job I found time to polish it off and run extensive UX testing with <em>real users</em> (sorry friends and random people on the plane for being annoying), and released in November 2018.</p><h2 id=choice-of-tech-stack>Choice of tech stack</h2><p>When I started building the game, frameworks such as React Native weren&rsquo;t very mature and the only cross-platform options out there were frameworks like Apache Cordova, which suffered from bad preformance, and, to be honest, had <strong>horrible</strong> interface.</p><p>On top of that, I was already fairly proficient with Java, so unfortunately you can only get my game on an Android device.</p></div></article><footer id=footer><div class=footer-left>Copyright &copy; 2023 Hungry Cats Studio</div><div class=footer-right><nav><ul><li><a href=../>Home</a></li><li><a href=../about>About</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=../lib/font-awesome/css/all.min.css><script src=../lib/jquery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=../js/main.js></script></html>
