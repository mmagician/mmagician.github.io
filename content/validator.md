# Network Validators

It turns out that unwanted DevOps experience and on-call rotations have proven useful, after all!

Having deployed to AWS & Hetzner in my previous roles made it fairly easy to spin up a couple of validators.

I'm involved in validation services via two separate entities: 
- [AMJ Stake](https://amj-stake.github.io/), which aims to provide a trusted validator for both Kusama and Polkadot
- mmagician (myself), so far participating in the [Kusama 1KV](https://thousand-validators.kusama.network/#/leaderboard) with two nodes

## Kusama

As mmagician, I'm running two validators, which are both part of the 1K Validator Program.
- `mmagician-0`: [DDufVxdkpbwuHYCnri1D4368MSNeXHQueA7AbhVG6r8jH1B](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/DDufVxdkpbwuHYCnri1D4368MSNeXHQueA7AbhVG6r8jH1B)
- `mmagician-1`: [HTpGQZf3Ea8b92oxmjRiSdfPPjU1Wy6kVVThZpdvnTCrF7P](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/HTpGQZf3Ea8b92oxmjRiSdfPPjU1Wy6kVVThZpdvnTCrF7P)

With AMJ, we also have two Kusama validators. `K0` is part of the 1KV, while `3 boys üë¶üë¶üë¶ 1 node üíª` has gained enough nominations to enter the active set organically.
- `K0`: [D8aDoqzNTeqbuxbZ79nHQZp95Nwew1nx3cz2uByMU5qBfhj](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/D8aDoqzNTeqbuxbZ79nHQZp95Nwew1nx3cz2uByMU5qBfhj) 
- `3 boys üë¶üë¶üë¶ 1 node üíª`: [Fwk8piU6ZfcD5o8cnYL83VjmxkZenBpyby74nnbMMP9AkZR](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Fwk8piU6ZfcD5o8cnYL83VjmxkZenBpyby74nnbMMP9AkZR) 

## Polkadot

As mmagician, I'm again running two validators:
- `mmagician-0`: [14JduA89X8KoFdbtFSmNrLdaCYdYEcNRftkNwHubxBsAn4Ca](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/14JduA89X8KoFdbtFSmNrLdaCYdYEcNRftkNwHubxBsAn4Ca)
- `mmagician-1`: [1qWTg2KdN7FD6zUd2Xdv8Fd3WRoTjuBoq4xLxne1p1naBsi](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/1qWTg2KdN7FD6zUd2Xdv8Fd3WRoTjuBoq4xLxne1p1naBsi)

With AMJ, we have 1 Polkadot validator:
- `Bobüë∑‚ÄçThe BlockBuilder‚õèÔ∏è`: [1ZFhpmBbsuPHo9fk3PjXc2xr76MYZkkaAWioXuNRktrcwsG](https://polkascan.io/polkadot/account/1ZFhpmBbsuPHo9fk3PjXc2xr76MYZkkaAWioXuNRktrcwsG)
