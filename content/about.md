# About

I lead a small research- and implementation-focused team Hungry Cats Studio, where we work on polynomial commitment schemes, proof composition, ZKML, signature schemes and other fun things.

I contribute to, and maintain, the [arkworks](/arkworks) ecosystem of libraries for building cryptographic primitives for SNARKs.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out doing some sports or reading.
