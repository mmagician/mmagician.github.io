# About


Currently I'm enjoying a self-imposed sabbatical. I spend my days learning cryptography, tinkering with proof systems and thinking about protocol design. I am a contributor and co-maintainer of [arkworks](/arkworks).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out doing some sports or reading.

I'm available for consulting work to help advance interesting projects (circuit optimization, cryptographic primitive implementation in Rust, protocol design, etc.) in a small capacity.
