# About

We are a small research- and implementation-focused team.  We work on polynomial commitment schemes, proof composition, ZKML, signature schemes and other fun things.

Hungry Cats Studio was founded by Marcin GÃ³rny, `mmagician`. He is a contributor and maintainer of the [arkworks](/arkworks) ecosystem of libraries for building cryptographic primitives for SNARKs.
