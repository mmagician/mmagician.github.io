# About

I currently work as a Research Engineer at the Web3 Foundation, coding up cryptographic primitives and seeing how they can be integrated into substrate.

On a side I contribute to [arkworks](/arkworks) and run a few [validator nodes](/validator).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out doing some sports or reading.
